	Horizontal Rule Tag
</h1>

<pre>-&gt;</pre>
<p>The rule tag simply places a horizontal rule on your page.  Any information that happens to be on the same line goes the the bit-bucket.  If you use the multi-line form, all the lines go to the bit-bucket.</p>


<h3>
	Clue:
</h3>

<pre>-&gt;&gt;</pre>
<p>If the remainder of your document disappears after this tag, it's because you forgot the second bracket.  I probably don't need to say that to you wise and learnˆd folk, but in the previous version of SWL (for which there were a total of 3 users: me, my friend, and my imaginary goldfish), the second bracket wasn't necessary so this notation has been an uphill battle for some of us (mostly the goldfish).</p>
<p>You can really help the aesthetic value of your document by overriding this tag with a graphic that fits in your document's theme.  See <a href="tag_macro.html">macro tags</a> for information on overriding.</p>

<h2>
	Mnemonic:
</h2>
<p>I realize that it doesn't look <i>that</i> much like a horizontal bar anymore.  It kinduh got burried in more and more brackets as the language generalized.  In fact, it officially looks more like a christmas tree than a divider now.  If that bothers you, just remember <i>National Lampoons' Christmas Vacation</i>.</p>
