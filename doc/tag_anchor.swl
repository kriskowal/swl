1>Anchor Tag

">j</i>&gt;<i>anchor_name

An anchor in HTML is what you would call a bookmark anywhere else.  To create a link to an anchor in SWL, simply place this tag anywhere in your code:

">&lt; #<i>anchor_name</i> "<i>label</i>" &gt;

3>Mnemonic
'j' was chosen to represent the anchor tag because the letter somewhat resembles a boat anchor.  Bookmarks passing in the night, per se.
