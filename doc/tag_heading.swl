"><i>heading number</i>&gt;

There are 6 heading levels.  Just plunk the heading number on a line and put a hat on it.  The tag works pretty well in the multi-line format as well.

1>Heading 1
is the largest, whereas
6>Heading 6
is the smallest.


3>Note:
If you want a numbered < tag_list.html list >, use the '#'.
